The code in this repository allows you to, progamantically switch between RTL/LTR semantic CSS within your    
code using the minimum CSS code required to achieve it:   
`common.min.css` - is the common CSS code between ltr/rtl files.   
`rtl.min.css` - is the difference that allows RTL support. 
`ltr.min.css` - is the difference that allows LTR support.

/* First import the helper functions into your project.*/
   
/**...whatever code you want */
   
// Then in order to switch between RTL/LTR you must execute like this:
